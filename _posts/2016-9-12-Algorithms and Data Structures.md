title: On Algorithms and Data Structures. 

---

The fun parts of programming, with backstory. 

After completing Freecodecamp's basic algorithm challenges, I have been going around testing myself with algorithms on sites like Codewars and Codingame. Though I have completed a few algorithms at the 7-8 kyu level (Codewars), I want to know more on how to preceduralize problems related to programming. 

I was really influenced by [Dave Xiang's](https://www.youtube.com/user/daveXbang) advice on how to get started programming, as well as [Reddit's advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/44nrkz/when_to_start_learning_data_structures_and/) on when to learn algorithms and data structures. Both sources imply to learn after you have played around with a language. In my case, I played around with javascript, did SUPER basic javascript algorithms, and now feel like I should be learning the stated.

Xiang does note to just get an introduction of the concepts of algorithms and data structures, recommending to join an introdutory course for these concepts. With that in mind, I stumbled upon Edx's course from Havard, labeled the imfamous [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).

I have heard great things about the course, getting into the concepts of the programming language C, Sractch, and eventually going into web dev at the end of the course. With that being said, i'll report back here with my experience.
