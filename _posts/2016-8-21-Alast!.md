So this is what it feels like to blog? Feels weird, different. I like it.

I have used the world's most popular blogging CMS (Wordpress) before, but it feels so bloated and uncontrollable. Instead of wordpress for this site,
I am using the popular static site generator, Jekyll, and forked a template from the open source developer, [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark).

To do this, it required basic knowledge of Git, a version control system, terminal commands (because I run linux on my Thinkpad), and the installation of Ruby. 

I'm currently hosting this site on Github through my repository, thanks to Github's service, Github pages. I must say though, that the install was far from flawless, and I spent probably around 14 hours straight trying to get Github pages to recognize my Jekyll site. 

Solution: I just had to uninstall the latest version of Jekyll. I had to run Jekyll 3.1.6 instead of Jekyll 3.2.1.


Weird times we live in don't we? (Possible tutorial?)
