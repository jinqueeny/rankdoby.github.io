![A Wikipedia Viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wikiviewer_new.jpg)

	Metal Gear Solid fun times. 

So this is the third of Freecodecamp's intermediate challenges dubbed the [Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer). This project relies on calls to [Mediawiki's action API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) based on the textual input of the user, then manipulates the data to display on the page in the order that most closely resembles the input. This project is different from the other API projects that I have done, in the case that I actually had to write a specific script to display items in the correct order if the API was called more than once.

The main improvement that I must note to myself would be to change the description of items that have "from a modification..." to their correct description when viewing their actual Wikipedia page.
