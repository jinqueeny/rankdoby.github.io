My first Hackathon.

On the date of Ocotber 21st, 2016, I attended my first hackathon with CSULB's chapter of ACM. The hackathon was being held at UCR dubbed Citrus Hack. Within the 36 hour event, I witnessed hundreds of other students developing, hacking, and demoing their creations in the form of software and hardware in efforts to experiment, please judges, and/or meet new people. Without a doubt, I must say that the hackathon does a good job in placing a good vibe in everyone to create something. I soon found myself challenging myself for the next 24 hours as hacking officially started at 9 PM. 

Quickly, I found myself completing 90% of a project dubbed the [Wikipedia Viewer](http://yasirsoulong.me/WikipediaViewer), but I soon blew myself out as I checked the time on my computer and found that I had successfully pulled an all nighter, which led to hunger, then drowsiness. 

A couple of things I learned at this event that everyone should be aware of when attending a hackathon: 

- Most people have teams when attending hackathons. 

- Communication with anyone is a must. Keeps your sanity high and allows for opportunities and sharing of information. 

- Pack lightly. Your not going to be changing much clothes in my opinion. 

- Deodorant is a must. 

- bring some sort of hat. Your hair is going to get messy.
