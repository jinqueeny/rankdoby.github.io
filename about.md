![It's me!]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/invert.jpg)

My name is Yasir Soulong. I am an up and coming self-taught web developer who is learning today's languages and technologies which involve the HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL. 

I built my first website while I was attending high school. It was built using a content management system called Joomla! And ever since that day I vowed to live by two things: to learn more about web development, and to stay away from Joomla! (Seinfeld: Not that there's anything wrong with that...)

Though it has been a while since starting out, I can remember how  overwhelmed I was because of how big the field of web development actually is. The question of "What to learn?", "How to learn?", and "how do you do xxx?" gets asked daily everywhere, and though I don't have all the answers as well, I want to at least share my experience and teach my knowledge to those that are in similar shoes.

While I am learning more about the intricacies of web development, I am simultaneously attending CSULB for my bachelor's degree, and though challenging, I wouldn't change a thing. 

### Things I like other than web dev: 

- Skateboarding
- Counter Strike
- Using my telescope
- Playing volleyball 
- Thinkpads
