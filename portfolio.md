# Sites: 

## [Politics in the Air](http://politicsintheair.com/)

![politicsintheair]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/politicsintheair.jpg)

This is the first website I made that wasn't for me. 

I made this site for a friend who is majoring in political science. Wait, scratch that. He dreams in political science and wants to be lawyer.

## [My Original Portfolio Site](http://rankdoby.github.io/Portfolio/)

![orig_portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/orig_portfolio.png)

This is my first portfolio site I made for myself. It was a part of [Freecodecamp's](http://freecodecamp.com/) basic projects, and although it does look pretty horrible, I like to look back at it from time to time to see how far I have progressed.

# Projects: 

## [A Wikipedia Viewer.](http://yasirsoulong.me/WikipediaViewer/)

![A Wikipedia Viewer]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/wikiviewer_new.jpg)

This is the third project that is a part of Freecodecamp's intermediate projects dubbed as a Wikipedia Viewer. This project required calling JSON (JSONP) data from [Mediawiki's](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) action API and return back related Wikipedia pages based on the textual input of the user. The user can also request for a random article on Wikipedia as well.

## [A Weather Web App.](http://yasirsoulong.me/weatherapp/)

![A Weather Web App]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/weatherapp.jpg)

This is a project I made for myself and is the second of Freecodecamp's intermediate projects. This project required implementing data from your location using a geolocation API to retrieve the client's latitude and longitude. Then by using a weather API, in my case, [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs), I inputed the latitude and longitude into Wunderground's query parameters. This outputted JSON data relative to your location that I then manipulated onto a web page. 

*Note: the geolocation API was meant to be used as a part of the requirement for the project, but due to Chrome requiring their geolocation API to be used only over https, I resorted to using an API that tracks down the location of the client's IP address called [freegeoip](https://freegeoip.net/?q=47.152.176.50).*

The project displays the current weather in your location, an icon that changes depending on the weather, and has a button that allows the user to convert Fahrenheit into Celcius and back.

## [A Random Quote Machine.](http://yasirsoulong.me/quote-machine/)

![quote-machine]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/quote-machine.png)

This is a project I made for myself and was a part of [Freecodecamp's](http://freecodecamp.com/) intermediate projects. This project was used as an introduction to APIs by retrieving JSON (JSONP) data from the api, and incorporating that data onto a website that simply displayed a random quote every time you pushed the "new quote" button. 

At the user's expense, the user can also tweet the quote with the author as a hastag.

The api I used was from [Forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/api/), which was free and didn't require creating an account for api keys.
