This is the first website I made that wasn't for me. 

I made this site for a friend who is majoring in political science. Wait, scratch that. He dreams in political science and wants to be lawyer.

# Projects: 

## [A random quote machine. (work in progress!)](http://yasirsoulong.me/quote-machine/)

![quote-machine]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/quote-machine.png)

This is a project I made for myself to practice the usage of apis to display random quotes of humankind. 

The api I used was from [Forismatic](http://forismatic.com/en/api/), which was free and didn't require creating an account for api keys. 

*Notes: This is still a work in progress. The responsivity of the project when applied on the phones and tablets is not good, and there are quotes that encapsulate the author of the quote.* 

Technolgoies used: 

- html 
- css 
- Bootstrap 
- Jquery 
- APIs
